# ML-exercise-sklearn
This section is a collection for Machine Learning exercise using Python and sklearn.
Most of the model are presenting with the evidence value to determine which objects are :
  1. The most positive object w.r.t the probabilities
  2. The most negative object w.r.t the probabilitis
  3. Has the largest positive evidence
  4. Has the largest negative evidence
  5. The most uncertain w.r.t the probabilities (Closer to .5)
  
Using some variant datasets, I implemented to the classification model :
  1. Decision Tree
  2. Naive Bayes
  3. Logistic Regression
